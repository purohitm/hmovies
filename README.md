# React Movie App
https://hmovvies.netlify.app/

## Project Description

The React Movie App is a web application designed to provide users with an intuitive and engaging platform to explore movies. Users can search for movies, view detailed information about them, and discover trending or popular films. The app is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and leverages modern web development practices to ensure a seamless user experience.

The application is deployed on Netlify, making it accessible to users worldwide. It is responsive and optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring accessibility across various screen sizes. The app fetches movie data from a third-party API, providing up-to-date and accurate information about movies, including their titles, release dates, ratings, and descriptions.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), which simplifies the setup and configuration of a React project. The app is designed to be lightweight, fast, and easy to navigate, making it suitable for movie enthusiasts of all ages.

## Accessibility Considerations

Accessibility is a key focus of the React Movie App. The following measures have been implemented to ensure the app is usable by a diverse audience, including individuals with disabilities:

1. **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements, such as buttons and links, are fully navigable using a keyboard. This ensures that users who cannot use a mouse can still interact with the app.

2. **Screen Reader Support**: The app includes semantic HTML and ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes to enhance compatibility with screen readers. This allows visually impaired users to understand and navigate the app effectively.

3. **Color Contrast**: The app's color scheme has been designed to meet WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) standards for contrast, ensuring readability for users with visual impairments or color blindness.

4. **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive, adapting to various screen sizes and orientations. This ensures that users on mobile devices, tablets, and desktops have an equally accessible experience.

5. **Alt Text for Images**: All images, including movie posters, include descriptive alt text to provide context for users relying on screen readers.

## Ethical Considerations

The React Movie App adheres to ethical principles in its design and functionality:

1. **Data Privacy**: The app does not collect or store any personal user data. All interactions with the app are anonymous, ensuring user privacy.

2. **Content Accuracy**: The app fetches movie data from reliable third-party APIs to ensure the information displayed is accurate and up-to-date. This prevents the spread of misinformation.

3. **Inclusive Design**: The app is designed to be inclusive, catering to users with diverse needs and abilities. Accessibility features are prioritized to ensure no user is excluded.

4. **Open Source**: The project is built using open-source technologies, promoting transparency and collaboration within the developer community.

5. **No Harmful Content**: The app does not promote or display harmful, offensive, or inappropriate content. It is designed to be a safe platform for all users.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
